# TicketCalculator
Program asks user for total number of tickets sold in a theatre. 
- The theatre has two groups, the floor and balcony. The floor can hold 200 people, 100 in the front and 100 in the back. 
- - People are populated to the front floor first and the back second. If all seats are sold in the floor area, program will then populate the rest to the balcony. 
That said, the program will output the front and back floor tickets and the receipt along with the balcony ticket receipt and gross receipts and profit with correct format.
